In 2011, the first widely accepted remote compromise, or hack, of a production vehicle was accomplished by a team of researchers at the University of California, San Diego (Checkoway et al., 2011), against a 2011 Chevy Malibu. The researchers were able to cause the car’s brakes to lock up while driving using two different remote attack vectors.

In 2015, researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek remotely controlled the steering, braking, acceleration, and other controls of a 2015 Jeep Cherokee (Miller & Valasek, 2018). They noted that automotive control messages should be protected with modern encryption mechanisms, like TLS, to ensure authenticity and integrity. The researchers reported being shocked to learn that the manufacturers stated they would first have to find a way to implement TCP in automotive networks before they could handle SSL or TLS encryption, both of which require establishment of a TCP session.

Additional high-profile hacks were demonstrated against electric vehicles, including a 2016 Tesla Model S and a 2018 BMW i3 by Tencent’s Keen Security Lab. And, while most of these cyber-physical attack vectors were rapidly addressed by the manufacturers, fundamental security concerns remain, especially when physical access to the vehicle is possible. Many researchers include internet- connected automobiles among the growing Internet of Things (IoT), and note significant cybersecurity concerns as once-isolated devices and machines are interconnected across both wired and wireless IP networks (Payne & Abegaz, 2018).
